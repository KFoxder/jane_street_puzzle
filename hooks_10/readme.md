# Jane Street Puzzle: Hooks 10
This is my solution for Jane Street's Puzzle [Hooks 10](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/hooks-10-index/)

## Usage

If you run the runner script it will solve the puzzle across all cores available. 
This takes ~25 seconds on a M2 machine with 12 cores.
Credit goes to @AveryLevin who helped me reduce the runtime from 
20 minutes to 25 seconds by reducing the search space.
